- Enrollments, progress tracking  
- Role-based access control  
- REST API backend + modern frontend UI  
- Modular architecture to support extension

## 🧰 Tech Stack

| Layer        | Technology / Framework        |
|---------------|-------------------------------|
| Backend        | Spring Boot (Java)            |
| Frontend        | React / Vue / Angular (specify) |
| Database        | MySQL / PostgreSQL / H2 (specify) |

## 🏗 Architecture / Modules

- **backend** – holds the REST API, service logic, persistence layer  
- **frontend** – UI client app (SPA)  
- Shared / common modules (if any)  
- Configuration, security, utilities  

---

## 🛠 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Java JDK 11+  
- Maven  
- Node.js & npm / yarn  
- A relational database (MySQL/PostgreSQL)  
- (Optional) Postman / API client  

### Setup Backend

```bash
cd backend
# Configure application.properties / application.yml (DB, JWT secrets etc.)
mvn clean install
mvn spring-boot:run
````

### Setup Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
# install dependencies
npm install    # or yarn
# start development server
npm run dev     # or yarn dev / serve, etc.
```

After both parts are running, open your browser at `http://localhost:3000` (or whatever port your frontend uses).
